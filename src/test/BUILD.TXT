In the "test_suite" folder you will find the "rinchi_test_suite" project, both
as an MSVC solution file ("rinchi_test_suite_msvc.sln") for builiding on Windows
with Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 or later, and as a QT creator project file
("rinchi_test_suite_qt.pro") for builiding on Linux.

Builds on Linux can also be done by directly using the Makefile-s produced by qmake.

The test suite requires the boost libraries boost-filesystem and boost-system
so you will need those two development libraries present in order to build. The
test suite was developed using boost 1.40 on Linux and boost 1.57 on Windows so
boost version 1.40 or later should be sufficient.

When building with Visual Studio you will most likely have to adjust the include
path in the solution file to match your location and version of Boost (Project
Property pages => Configuration Properties => C/C++ => General => Additional
Include Directories).

Locally built Boost libraries on Linux or Mac requires that you add the boost
include path to the makefile's INCPATH and the boost lib path to the LFLAGS,
e.g.:

	INCPATH       = -I. [...] -I/Users/userxxx/boost/boost_1_80_0
	LFLAGS        = -m64 -L/Users/userxxx/boost/boost_1_80_0/stage/lib

To successfully run the test suite, make sure that its working directory is this
directory, that is: .../src/test/. This is setup in the MSVC and QT project, but
if you run the test executable directly you need to explicitly take care of the
working directory, e.g.

	cd %RINCHI_ROOT%\src\test\
	.\test_suite\Release\rinchi_test_suite_msvc.exe

One of the tests is an InChI regression test that checks that molfiles read by
RInChI produces InChIs that match what the standard InChI 1.06 executable produces.
This test uses a standard test dataset from InChI 1.06 which can be found in
.../src/test/INCHI-1_testset/. The full InChI 1.06 test data set can be downloaded
by using the script .../scripts/download_inchi_test_data.sh.

NOTE:
	The debug Windows builds are configured to skip this regression test. The debug build
	makes the regression test very very slow - so use a Release build to enable the
	regression test when on Windows.
