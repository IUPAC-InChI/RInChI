Since this DLL/shared library is meant to be loaded from Python there should be
no need to build "Debug" builds. Make sure that the bitness of the DLL/shared
library that you produce matches the bitness of your Python version.

If you are on an arm64 Mac (e.g. an M1) with an x86_64 Python, the shared
library must be built with the Makefile-Mac-arm64-with-x86-Python makefile.
This builds an x86_64 library so it can be loaded from x86_64 Python.

If you use the supplied makefiles the resulting shared library will be output
in the current directory and the default path in the "test.py" example script
should work. Otherwise, adjust the path to the DLL/shared library in the first
line of "test.py" where the RInChI lib is instantiated.

The output from "test.py" should exactly match the text in
"test.py.expected_output.txt". To verify that, you can run the script like
this:

	python test.py > /tmp/test.py.out.txt
	diff -u /tmp/test.py.out.txt test.py.expected_output.txt

There should be no output from the "diff" command.
