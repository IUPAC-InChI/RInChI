Since this DLL/shared library is meant to be loaded from Python there should be
no need to build "Debug" builds. Make sure that the bitness of the DLL/shared
library that you produce matches the bitness of your Python version.

To run the "test.py" example file, adjust the path to the DLL/shared library
in the first line where the RInChI lib is instantiated.

Mac: To be able to make the project using the Makefile_Macos makefile, make
sure that a compiler of version 6 is available with g++-6 and gcc-6 aliases.
