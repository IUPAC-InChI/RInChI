This directory includes the two sub-directories:

INCHI         contains code, VC++ projects and gcc makefiles of
              inchi-1 (command-line program). 
              For the details, see file readme.txt in the sub-directory.

INCHI_API     contains code, VC++ projects and gcc makefiles of
              InChI generation library and sample application which
              uses the Library. The library produces both standard
              and non-standard InChI/InChIKey. For the details, see file 
              readme.txt in the sub-directory.
