# Building
RInChI uses InChI 1 as its foundation and so the InChI source code is included
in the INCHI-1-SRC folder. The INCHI-1-SRC folder is the result of running
`scripts/download_inchi_source.sh`. Note that the script unpacks the downloaded
archive into the current folder.

RInChI has been built with Visual Studio 2019 on Microsoft Windows and GCC on
Linux, Mac and Raspberry Pi. Tested platforms are Microsoft Server 2016
(32- and 64-bit builds), CentOS 7 (x86_64-bit builds only), Mac OS Monterey
12.6 (Mac M1), and Debian Stretch and Debian Bullseye on Raspberry Pi (Arm v7).

On Windows .SLN files are available. On Linux you can load the .pro project
files into QtCreator or use the provided Makefile-s generated by qmake (and
then fixed-up by script to remove qmake-dependencies and adjust for Mac and
Raspberry environments).

If any RInChI app requires special configuration before building, a BUILD.TXT
file will be present in the app's directory.
