# Building
RInChI uses InChI 1 as its foundation and so the InChI source code is included
in the INCHI-1-SRC folder. The INCHI-1-SRC folder is the result of running
`scripts/download_inchi_source.sh`. Note that the script unpacks the downloaded
archive into the current folder.

RInChI has been built with Visual Studio 2010 on Microsoft Windows and GCC on
Linux. Tested platforms are Microsoft Windows 7 64-bit (32- and 64-bit builds),
Debian 7.7 (32-bit and 64-bit builds) and Debian Wheezy Linux on Raspberry Pi
(Arm v6 32-bit).

On Windows .SLN files are available. On Linux you can load the .pro project
files into QtCreator or use the provided Makefile-s generated by qmake (and
then hand-edited to remove qmake-dependencies).

If any RInChI app requires special configuration before building, a BUILD.TXT
file will be present in the app's directory.
